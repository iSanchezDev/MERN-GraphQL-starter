## Description

This project aims to get `GraphQL` `query` and `mutation` examples from the client side made for `MERN` stack development.

## Client

The client allows you to connect with the `GraphQL API` it requests a user list and also adding users as example.

## API

Was designed on `TypeScript` for `GraphQL` has `JWT` authorization implemented for users from the client app and also 
for `Apollo Client` web tool. 

Run your queries safely on this tool even in your future production environment with the auth middleware implemented. 

I have a REST service on express for `login` and `logout` users in a secure mode isolated from GraphQL.
